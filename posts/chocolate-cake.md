“Mom I’m going out with friends to celebrate, I will be back around 2 a.m.,” Nirvi shouted and stepped out of the house. There was a car waiting outside her building, she opened the door and was greeted with birthday wishes; she smiled, got in the car, and enquired. “So where are we going?” “So babe remember my friend Ojas, he came through. He got us the bottle service at O pedros.” Kunal, her boyfriend said. “OMG! That’s absolutely amazing! I love you so much!” She said and kissed him. “Again, why are we here Aman?” Nirvi’s friend, Aarya complained. “Oh don’t be so salty Aarya. Today is Nirvi’s day” she winked, and Aarya rolled her eyes.

“Mom I’m going out with friends to celebrate, I will be back around 2 am” “Okay, fine. Enjoy and be safe.” Vrinda shouted back, and after a few seconds, she heard the door getting shut. She sighed and continued with her book. She just could not get herself to write today. The stupid fight that she had with Nirvi kept bothering her. “I shouldn’t have said that,” she said to herself and got up and went to the kitchen. She opened a bottle of wine, poured herself some, and took a sip. “Hmmm… this is good.” She tied her hair up and decided to bake her famous chocolate cake.

“Happy Birthday once again, babe. I love you so much. I wish all your dreams and wishes come true this year.” Kunal said while hugging and kissing her. “Okay, I’m not gonna deny that was super cute. But now you’re making us jealous.” Aarya commented. “I love you too Aarya!” Nirvi said and kissed her on the cheeks. “Thank you so much, guys! You are my people, and… I just love you all.” “Happy Birthday again Nirvi, also you’re drunk so go home now.” “Yes boss” Nirvi joked and said her goodbyes. Once she was in her building lift she opened a food delivery app to order as she didn’t want to go to bed hungry and drunk.

Nirvi opened the door and she heard some music so she went towards the living room, and found her mom waiting for her with a cake. “Happy Birthday baby girl!” Nirvi smiled and kissed her mom. “Maa, you didn’t have to do this. I’m a 22-year-old woman now.” “Well as the age-old saying goes, you’re always going to be my baby. My 2-year-old baby, who cried because I made the mistake of getting a fruit cake rather than a chocolate cake.” “It was ‘chowcat’ cake” Nirvi mocked, and they both burst into laughter. “You were so cute,” Vrinda said. “I know.” And Nirvi agreed. “You’re drunk. Come on let’s cut the cake.” “So are you mom. Have you left any wine for me?” “I’ve just had one glass.” Vrinda defended.

They both sat on the sofa and gorged on the cake while listening to some jazz music. “I’m sorry baby girl.” “For the cake? It’s been ages now Mom. I know it was a huge mistake, but I’ve forgiven you.” Nirvi teased. “I’m apologizing for today.” Vrinda said and Nirvi laid her head on her mom’s shoulder and said, “Oh that, well it’s a tradition, Maa. You always do some fuck up on my birthday and I forgive you.” She joked again, and Vrinda just smiled and kissed her daughter’s forehead.

A few minutes later, the bell rang. “Who’s come at this hour?” “Oh, I had ordered some food as I was hungry,” Nirvi said and went to get the food. “We can have it for breakfast now. What did you order?” “Oh, that’s such a good idea, breakfast sorted. Just open it and see na. I’ll go and change.” Vrinda opened the packaging, there was a burrito, pav bhaji, and shrikhand. She was confused, “Nirvi?” she shouted and after a few minutes Nirvi hugged her and said, “About 23 years ago, you went through the worst pain in your life, and after enduring that, all you wanted was pav bhaji and shrikhand. You did good then and you still are killing it maa, so you deserve this as much as I deserve the chocolate cake.” She winked and kissed her mom good night. Vrinda was all teary-eyed; she took a big spoonful of shrikhand, closed her eyes, and relished it.
