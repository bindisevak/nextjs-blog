“Can I help you with something?” “Umm. No. Actually, yes. I’m looking for the latest, newest kid toy?” “How old is the kid?” “Oh, he is 4 and super smart.” “Okay, so this section here has all the toys for 4 years old; these are our top sellers here.” “Oh, that helps a lot! Thank you so much. I did seem lost and out of place right?” The store assistant smiled earnestly at me. After browsing for a bit, I bought the most expensive toy, and then left.

“I need coffee.” I blurted out my mind and started walking towards a cafe. “Can I get a cappuccino and one chocolate macaron and one pistachio macaron, please?” “Name for the order?” “Tisha”. I grabbed the coffee and macarons and took a seat. It had been a long day of shopping, but finally, I had shopped for everyone in the family. All that was left was to buy me a gift. That thought brought my energy back, or maybe it was the coffee. I checked my phone while sipping coffee; there were no messages or calls. ‘My life is sad.’ I went on bumble and did some swiping and then when I got bored, I went to Instagram and checked some reels. That’s what life had come to.

My body was aching with all the walking and shopping, but my heart was set to go buy that gift that I had been eyeing for a while now. I grabbed all my shopping bags and started walking towards the shop. There was a long queue for something; after walking for a few minutes I realized the queue was to take a picture with Santa. There was a lot of commotion, kids crying, and parents wishing they could cry. ‘Well thank God I don’t have kids.’ I chuckled, at that thought and then at the very next instant felt some sort of emptiness. But before I could go down the rabbit hole, my eyes finally saw something comforting, ‘Louis Vuitton’.

I went inside the store and saw many couples; men buying gifts for their beloved partners. Some single men trying to buy Christmas gifts, and asking the sales assistants all sorts of questions. I browsed for a bit and then went to one of the assistants, “how can I help you today?” I told her what I was looking for, and she suggested some more options, and I tried them all, “Is this for you?” “Umm, yeah it is, I think I’m going to go with this one.” “Very good choice. Many women have been buying gifts for themselves this Christmas.” “It is about time that happened, isn’t it?” She smiled at that and went ahead to get me a fresh piece. I was out of the store in about 20 minutes. Later, I checked some more shops and bought some more stuff for myself.

It was 8 pm and I was starving, so I decided to go to one of the ramen places at the mall. I was craving a nice comforting ramen after a long day of shopping. After devouring my dinner, I decided to head home. The drive was surprisingly peaceful. I went up to my apartment, placed all the bags down, and sat down on the sofa; I was tired. I switched on the TV and started an episode of the show I was currently into. I looked out of my living room window, people were on the streets. It was the holiday season and people were partying. I switched off the tv and decided to go down to a bar, and get a drink. I touched up my makeup, painted my lips red, and decided to head out for a quick drink.

&nbsp;

I went to my favorite bar, took a seat, and waited for my favorite bartender to notice me, “Hey, you.” “How are you doing Henry?” “I’m good. What are we drinking tonight?” “Can I get an Old Fashioned, please?” “Sure thing.” I always made sure I got my drink from Henry, he was the best and more importantly, he knew how I liked my drinks. It was busy, for a Thursday night; it was the holiday rush. “Thank you, Henry. Yeah, close the tab, I’m here for just one drink.” I then took a sip of the drink, and it was heavenly. It was exactly what I needed, in this weather. “What are you having there?” A guy next to me asked, I put my glass down, and turned to face him, “Ummm… Hey… I’m having an Old Fashioned. What are you drinking?” I asked, but I saw the beer glass, so I knew, also I couldn’t concentrate, because he was so damn handsome. ‘Man, am I drunk already? Why is he so gorgeous?’ I thought to myself and just smiled at him. I had no idea what he was saying. “This is my brother.” “Hello there. Yeah, the music is loud. I’m drinking Old Fashioned. Yeah, it’s good.” I answered, I wasn’t sure if they were the right answers, I just couldn’t hear. But he seemed happy with the answers, also he was super drunk too so it didn’t matter. ‘I’ll be back.’ His brother said, and left. The DJ then played A mellow song, so I took my chance.

&nbsp; 

“So how’s your night going?” I asked, to start a conversation. “Pretty good. It’s a lovely bar.” “That it is.” My mind was running blank. I tried sipping more of my drink to get some courage. “Are you alone?” “Yeah, I am. I just came to get a drink, and…” Before I could continue, he put his arm around me and said, “I knew it. I like you, even I go out alone to bars and those are the best nights.” We chatted more and shared our experiences of going to bars alone. “It’s crazy busy here. Do you live nearby?” “Yeah, I live just a block away. How about you?” I asked. “Oh, I grew up here, but now I live in San Diego. Came here to visit family.” “Oh wow, really? I grew up in San Diego, and now I live here because of work.” We both were pleasantly surprised at that. “Cheers to that.” He said, and we drank our drinks. His brother came back, and the DJ amped up the music again.

“By the way, I never introduced myself, I am Mike” “Nice to meet you, Mike, I am Tisha.” I said and we clinked our glasses again. I was getting a call, but in no way I was gonna leave my seat. I just couldn’t get my eyes off him. “What are you drinking tonight?” Someone on the other side asked me, “Umm… Hey, it’s just an Old Fashioned.” He wasn’t bad looking either. “Has somebody told you that you are the most beautiful girl at this bar?” “Hahaha. I will take that compliment, but I am not, and also…” Before I could continue, Mike put his hand around me and I turned to face him, “you can tell him I’m your boyfriend.” “Oh, really?” “Of course, look at us, we make an amazing couple.” He said and kissed me on my cheeks. ‘WHAT’S HAPPENING TONIGHT? AM I DREAMING OR SOMETHING?’ The other guy left, and Mike and I continued flirting. He laughed at all my jokes, he definitely was drunk, “You have a cute smile.” I complimented him, and Mike went red with embarrassment, which made him even more attractive. 
###
&nbsp;

The brother met some old friends, and so I got a chance to talk more with Mike. It was just so perfect, the only issue was, I don’t think he was going to remember any of that the next day. We also did some seated dance moves; it was lovely. His brother came back and asked the bartender to close the tab. “We gotta go now, beautiful.” He said to me, “Oh really? So soon.” I flirted. Mike got up, cupped my face, and kissed me. It was a short, but a perfect kiss. He hugged me and they left.

&nbsp; 

I was stranded there, shocked, wanting more. I sat down and took a big sip of my drink. “Did you get his number?” Henry asked, and I looked at him all sad. “I fucking didn’t.” I rested my head down, “Here, have this.” “I don’t…” “Just have it.” He said, and I drank. I went home and went straight to bed.  ‘This is the worst Christmas Misfortune anyone can have’ I said to myself before dozing off.
###
&nbsp; 

I woke up the next morning and was a little sad about not exchanging numbers with Mike. Later I got busy with packing, and then at about 10 am, I started my drive to go to San Diego. I reached home around 6:30 pm, greeted everyone, and enjoyed a nice mom-cooked meal. “Let’s go to The Shout!” My sister suggested. “I’m not in the mood, I’m tired from all the driving,” I said. “Oh, come on let’s go, they have these holiday special drinks that are delicious.” My brother said, “Come on, let’s go!” My sister dragged me. Once at the bar, I ordered one of their holiday cocktails, “Thank you, this is delicious.” “I’m glad you liked it. I have never seen you here.” My sister answered for me, “She’s our sister. And Lil sis, this is Mike, he makes the best cocktails in all of San Diego, and he also has a very cute smile.” “Well, it seems that’s common in all the Mikes,” I said and took a big sip of my cocktail. I just laughed at the coincidence. Maybe it wasn't a misfortune, maybe it was my Christmas Miracle. I definitely needed that after all the heartbreaks I have had this year, I thought, and with that enjoyed my cocktail and some more with my siblings.
