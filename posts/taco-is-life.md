description: "There was definitely something in the tacos, because after sharing it, they both connected instantly, as if they were long lost sisters. They laughed and enjoyed each other's company, while sipping on cold beers, and munching on chips and salsa. They decided to take a stroll on the beach together, to burn some calories that they had just consumed. “So what was it like growing up in a joint family?” “It’s like an adventure. It has its ups and downs. But, if you’re with the right people, with whom your frequencies somewhat match, then the ups are a lot more than the downs.” “That’s super cool and very intriguing.” Irene said. “Oh, have you tried this coffee place?” Irene pointed at a small coffee shack. “Nope, I haven’t.” “Oh, you have to. They have a very interesting origin story.” Irene said, while they both got themselves a coffee. They walked for almost an hour at the beach, while occasionally taking breaks and sitting on a nearby bench."

Tania took her first sip of the cold beer, looked at the view in front of her and sighed. It had been a taxing year; she hadn’t been to the beach in a year, even though she stayed just three miles away. “Would you like to order food?” “Can I get some chips and salsa to start with, and a side of guacamole.” “Sure, I will get that for you.” Tania waited for half an hour to get a spot at this Mexican restaurant that overlooked the beach. Today all she wanted to do was eat, drink and read. She took out her kindle and started reading and just then her phone beeped, she ignored it. But, then it beeped again, and again. She sighed and checked her phone. She kept her kindle away and took her work laptop out.

She had taken a day off, but she had to get on a work call; it was a critical customer issue. People came and left, but she was still there, on the call. It went on for 2 hours. “Okay Steve, let’s go ahead with that. Yeah, it’s okay. I understand. Happy Friday to you too. Okay bye then.” The call finally ended. She sighed, and kept her laptop. “Having a busy day? Would you like to order something?” Tania rolled her eyes, and responded, “Yes please, I am starving.  Can I get three chicken tacos, and one of your lagers, please.” “Sure, I will be right back with that.”  She gazed at the beach, and got lost in her thoughts. All she wanted to do today was have one day to herself with no responsibilities and of doing nothing, but... “I hope you were able to resolve that problem.” Tania was startled, she turned and saw a pretty woman looking at her. She took a moment and then replied,. “Umm Yeah, I did. Thanks”

&nbsp;

“Hi, My name is Irene.” “I am Tania. I love your dog.” “Oh, thanks. Charles is my buddy, my man.” Charles started sniffing Tania “Hey Charles” she said and started petting him. “You are by yourself?” Irene asked “You think anyone would want to be with a woman who’s taking work calls in the middle of such a lovely Friday? You should have seen the stink eyes I got when I was on my call.” “Hahaha… Well, this world is full of such imbeciles. Forget them, I am sure there are tons of other, better people who would want to be with such a strong, independent, and beautiful woman.” Tania blushed and thanked her. “Do you mind if I join you?” Tania asked “Only if I get a bite of that chicken tacos, they look so scrumptious.” “Absolutely, they indeed are very juicy and yummy!”

There was definitely something in the tacos, because after sharing it, they both connected instantly, as if they were long lost sisters. They laughed and enjoyed each other's company, while sipping on cold beers, and munching on chips and salsa. They decided to take a stroll on the beach together, to burn some calories that they had just consumed. “So what was it like growing up in a joint family?” “It’s like an adventure. It has its ups and downs. But, if you’re with the right people, with whom your frequencies somewhat match, then the ups are a lot more than the downs.” “That’s super cool and very intriguing.” Irene said. “Oh, have you tried this coffee place?” Irene pointed at a small coffee shack. “Nope, I haven’t.” “Oh, you have to. They have a very interesting origin story.” Irene said, while they both got themselves a coffee. They walked for almost an hour at the beach, while occasionally taking breaks and sitting on a nearby bench.

“Do you want to go dancing?” Irene asked. “Dancing? I don’t know...” “Oh, come on.” I know this good bar, I know the DJ there, and also they only take vaccinated people. Please come” Irene tried to convince, and after a couple of no’s Tania finally agreed. “We will have to stop at my place first, though. It’s Charles dinner time. I’ll serve him dinner and then we can go.” “Umm… Okay.” Tania said skeptically “Don’t be so shy. You will love my place.”
###
&nbsp;

Irene’s house was just two blocks away from where they were. “OMG!” Tania gasped, as soon as she entered the house. “I told you, didn’t I?” Irene smirked. Tania was flabbergasted. The house was spacious; as soon as you entered, you could smell lilies and roses, and each room had its own vibe and smell. One thing that was common in the entire house was the soothing plants. They were not in your face, they were strategically placed in a way that you wouldn’t notice at first, but the second or the third time you would. “What do you do for a living, again?” Tania asked. Irene locked eyes with Tania, and after a minute she smiled and replied, “I am an interior designer and a yoga instructor.” Tania looked away and after several moments said “I love your house and your… your life.” Irene smiled at that remark and started to serve dinner to Charles.

After half an hour, Irene got dressed for the party and offered some of her clothes to Tania. “I am good. This is good, isn’t it?” Tania pointed at her outfit. Irene gasped. “Fine, wear this jacket, and let me do your makeup.” After another half hour they called an uber to get to the bar.
###
&nbsp; 

“Cheers to new friendships” Irene clinked her third shot glass with Tania and two other girls they made friends with, at the bar. They danced their hearts out, they laughed and enjoyed themselves. Tania hadn’t had that much fun in a long time;  she had never in her life danced her heart out. She was happy.  It was almost midnight, when they decided to grab a bite. The other two females decided to call it a night.

&nbsp;

“This taco tastes so so so good. ” Tania said. “That’s probably because you’re drunk.” “You’re absolutely right! On a normal day I would never come here.” Irene laughed at that and said, “I am going to get some chips and guacamole. I am craving it. Do you want anything?” she asked. Tania nodded a no. Irene was gone for a while. Tania looked around and saw some people making out, and her mind wandered off. She shook her head, drank a glass of water and ordered for some more. She checked her phone, and started texting when, “so they don’t have guacamole so I just got some more tacos.” “Oh, I am sorry.” Tania said. “Are you sure you don’t want any?Just look how succulent they are.” Irene tempted Tania, and she finally gave in. “Damn, give me a bite.”
###
&nbsp; 

Tania had sobered down a bit and she finally let Irene talk, till then she had done all the talking. Irene spoke a lot about her life, stories about Charles. While Irene was telling her a story about Charles, Tania realized she had shared almost everything with this stranger, yet nothing. She sighed, and continued listening.
###
&nbsp; 

They finished their food and started walking, “We should call an Uber.” Tania suggested. “Yes!” Irene agreed. While they were waiting for their respective rides, Irene started telling a story of when she went to visit New Orleans. Tania stopped her mid sentence and said, “Irene, I loved spending this day with you. I haven’t had this much fun in a long, long  time. But, I am not… You know...” She paused, and Irene kissed her on her forehead. “I know! I figured that out in the first hour. I loved hanging with you as well, especially without all that tension. You know what I mean.” Tania smiled at that; she was relieved.
###
&nbsp; 

Both their rides arrived and Irene looked at Tania, held her hands, and said, “You’re holding way too much, let go. Please just let go. I’ve saved my number on your phone when you were not looking.” “How?” Irene rolled her eyes and said, “I am much smarter than you think. Call me, text me. I know you’re not ready yet, but when you’re ready to share the load that you’re carrying, I’ll be waiting to really hear you out.” She paused for a second, and. “In my beautiful house.” She winked, and kissed Tania on her forehead again. Tania was touched; they said their goodbyes, and when she was alone in the car, she closed her eyes and tears started rolling. She cried for a bit. Her phone beeped, Irene sent her a funny pic of both of them. She looked at it, chuckled and wiped away her tears.
